# Theater
This is a class project where we were instructed to make a website that allowed the user to enter a zip code, then show a list of theaters with that zip code. After, the user picks a theater, and is shown all of the movies and times for the selected theater. After choosing a time for a movie, the user then enters how many tickets they want, and enters a card number (not validated), and the seats are "bought." It was done using JSF, with the IDE being NetBeans. There is a local server that has all of the information about the theaters and movies. 

sqlCommandsWITHStringTimes.txt contains the SQL used to create the tables and add the data to them.

The Screens folder contains screenshots during execution of the program at all of the different pages.

Following the instructions, there were 3 zip codes that are "valid" for the user to input. 75074, 78701, 75455. Any others will work, but will return 0 results.
